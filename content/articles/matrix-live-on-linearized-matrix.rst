I demoed some of my work at `Element`_ on Matrix Live back on August 4th's
`This Week in Matrix`_ (and failed to mention it here). I talked a bit about
what `Linearized Matrix`_, Element's effort for the IETF's
`"More Instant Messaging Interoperability" (MIMI)`_ working group.

I demoed two `Synapse`_ instances as a dual-stack Matrix/Linearised Matrix
homeserver communicating over federation with two `eigen-server`_ instances, an
example greenfield Linearized Matrix server. THis work server as a proof of
concept for interoperability between Matrix and Linearized Matrix.

You can find a bit more about the approach (and the code) on `GitHub`_.

Check out the video below (my bit starts around the 5:27 mark) and let me know
if you have any questions!
