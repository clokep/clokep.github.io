I'm excited to share that a few weeks ago I started a new position at
`New Vector`_! They're the company behind `Matrix`_, "an open network for
secure, decentralized communication".

I'll be working on the reference backend server software used in Matrix
(`Synapse`_). The tech stack overlaps with `what I was using`_: mostly
`Python`_ code (specifically `Twisted`_). Additionally, most of my work will be
open-sourced (and developed in the open)! I've already
`had a few pull requests`_ merged and a couple of my changes are already in the
current version of Synapse (v1.11.1).

So far this has been a great change and I'm excited to work on a project that
has an intersection of a bunch of interests of mine (privacy, communications,
open-source, etc.) Let me know if you have any questions about Matrix! New
Vector is also `hiring for a bunch of positions`_ if you'd like to come work
with me!
